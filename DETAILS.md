# NEAStor

## What is this?

NEAStor is a digital library of student-made content that helps other people with ideas, inspiration and insights. 

You can upload your NEAs, EPQs, notes and more, with grades shown, to assist other people with difficult tasks.

## Why?

It all sparked from difficulties when looking for A* examples for my Geography NEA. 

After spending hours trawling through old forums I was only able to find a C grade example. And I thought, why don't I make this better for everyone?

Sharing your resources will help inspire, give confidence to and demonstrate what a good (or not-so-good!) resource is like, without showing the hard process involved in getting there, upholding academic integrity.

## Is it allowed?

tl;dr: Yes, providing that you share your resources after the current exam cycle has finished. After this, you are free to do what you want with your material, including sharing with other people.

It's not allowed for people to blatantly copy from your work. This will be easily detected by the exam board. 

## What's in it for me?

We're working on a way for ads to be shown alongside your content. We'll pay you most of the revenue we receive when advertisers pay us to show their content on the site.

This will be done in a completely anonymous and automated way.

## Who is supporting this?

Just a head student, head of year, head of sixth form, headteacher and an exams officer. Nobody too significant.
